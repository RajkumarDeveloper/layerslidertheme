				<!-- Installing / Updating: Installation -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="installation">Installation</h1>
					<h3 data-target="installation-file">Locate the install file</h3>
					<p>The main plugin package (that CodeCanyon offers to download by default) contains useful assets like the documentation, examples and source files. WordPress, however, expects a very specific install file. In order to provide you both the installable plugin and additional assets, we've bundled them together into one ZIP file. This is the reason why in most cases you will need to unpack the downloaded ZIP file first, then use the installable package inside.</p>
					<ol class="nomargin">
						<li>If you explicitly chose the <code>Installable WordPress file only</code> option when you've downloaded the plugin from CodeCanyon, then you have nothing to do. That is the file you will need to use during the installation.</li>
						<li>In any other cases, you will need to first unpack the ZIP file you've downloaded from CodeCanyon. The installable file will be inside, it's usually called something like <mark>"layersliderwp-x.x.x.installable.zip"</mark>.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3 data-target="installation-wp">Installation through the WP admin interface</h3>
					<ol class="nomargin">
						<li>Locate the installable file described in the above section.</li>
						<li>On your WordPress admin area navigate to <code>Plugins</code> -&gt; <code>Add new</code>, then press the <code>Upload Plugin</code> button on the top of the page.</li>
						<li>Choose the installable ZIP file mentioned previously, then hit the <code>Install Now</code> button.</li>
						<li>WordPress might ask you to enter your FTP login credentials. Click on <code>Proceed</code> when you've finished.</li>
						<li>The plugin is now installed, click on the <code>Activate Plugin</code> button.</li>
						<li>A new menu entry called <code>LayerSlider WP</code> should appear on your WordPress admin sidebar.</li>
					</ol>

					<div class="cf video-box">
						<a href="https://youtu.be/lq9EVoYeoM0" target="_blank" class="video">

						</a>
						<h4>How-to: Installing LayerSlider on a WordPress site</h4>
						<p>If you're unsure how to install the plugin, <br> just watch our short tutorial video.</p>
					</div>

					<h3 data-target="installation-ftp">Installation via FTP</h3>
					<ol class="nomargin">
						<li>Locate the installable ZIP file described at the top of this page, then unpack it.</li>
						<li>Open your favorite FTP application and connect to your server. Navigate to the <mark>"/wp-content/plugins/"</mark> folder.</li>
						<li>Copy over the <mark>"LayerSlider"</mark> folder extracted from the installable ZIP file.</li>
						<li>Navigate to the <code>Plugins</code> page on your WordPress admin area and click the <code>Activate</code> button below LayerSlider WP.</li>
						<li>A menu entry called <code>LayerSlider WP</code> should appear on your WordPress admin sidebar.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3 data-target="installation-troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Please be aware that you must use the <mark>"layersliderwp-x.x.x.installable.zip"</mark> file when you try to install the plugin on the WP admin area. The main package downloaded from CodeCanyon contains a lot of other assets. You must unpack it first, then find the above mentioned file inside for installation. The only exception is if you explicitly chose the Installable WordPress file only option on CodeCanyon.</li>
						<li>If you receive a <code>No valid plugins were found</code> error message, you've almost certainly uploaded the wrong ZIP file. Please read the previous point and the installation instructions again.</li>
						<li>The <code>Destination folder already exists</code> error message means that you already have another copy of LayerSlider installed and you can't use multiple versions simultaneously. Make sure to deactivate and delete the previous copy or check your theme settings to disable bundled versions (if any) before attempting to install the new release. This will not affect your sliders and settings, they will remain still and be available after you've finished installing the new version.</li>
						<li>In some very rare cases, certain server settings (e.g. upload size limit, memory limit) could prevent you to install the plugin from your WordPress admin area. If you're experiencing any issue, please contact your server host and ask them to change the relevant settings. Alternatively, you can also revert to the FTP installation method, so you don't have to wait in the meantime.</li>
						<li>If you receive an error message that says <code>"Are you sure you want to do this?"</code>, it's most likely the same server configuration issue explained in the previous point. WordPress displays this as a generic type of error message, so there could be other reasons as well.</li>
						<li>Your web hosting service provider might offer other methods to install plugins such as web-based FTP clients or 3rd party solutions made explicitly for WordPress. Although these should be fine, it's possible that in some cases they might not work as expected and you will need to revert to one of the conventional methods.</li>
						<li>If you're experiencing any issue after installing LayerSlider, please try to temporarily disable other plugins and switch to one of the default WordPress themes to see if it helps. LayerSlider should play along nicely with any plugin/theme you use, but incompatibility issues could occur due to several other reasons.</li>

				<!-- Installing / Updating: Activating the plugin -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="activation">Activating the plugin</h1>
					<h3 data-target="activation-intro">Why activating?</h3>
					<p>In addition to your purchase, you're entitled to the following exclusive features and services by activating your site with a purchase code:</p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Enjoy our priority support services to get help quickly and easily.</li>
						<li>Receive 1-Click plugin updates, including early access releases.</li>
						<li>Unlock premium features in the plugin providing new and interesting ways to extend the capabilities of your sliders.</li>
						<li>Import premium slider templates, which you can use as a starting point for your projects. We're releasing and updating premium content regularly.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 data-target="activation-bundles">I received LayerSlider bundled in my theme</h3>
					<p>We take plugin development very seriously and we're dedicated to offer the best product we can produce. Even if you're using a non-activated copy, it still has great features with almost unlimited capabilities to be a premium experience. Nevertheless, some additional features are only available for our direct buyers who have supported the plugin development by purchasing LayerSlider.</p>
					<p>Theme bundles is a great way to increase our popularity by offering our unique and useful products to the crowd. However, product development and customer support require a lot of resources thus we can only offer our services to our direct buyers. By offering some exclusive features we're encouraging users to support the development of future versions of LayerSlider.</p>


					<h3 data-target="activation-howto">How do I activate LayerSlider?</h3>
					<p>You just need to enter your <a href="#activation-purchase-code">Item Purchase Code</a> received after purchasing LayerSlider into the <mark>PRODUCT ACTIVATION</mark> section and press the <mark>Activate Now</mark> button.</p>

					<figure>

						</div>
						<figcaption>Illustration of the Product Activation section</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<h3 data-target="activation-sites">Can I activate multiple sites?</h3>
					<p>A purchase code can be used to activate 1 live site and up to 3 additional development installations. In line with the Envato's licensing terms, each site requires separate licenses with a unique purchase code. However, by <a href="#activation-transfer">deactivating your installation</a>, you can freely migrate your license to another server/domain if you're moving your site.</p>
					<div>
						An installation is considered a development environment if the site URL is either:
						<ul class="nomargin">
							<li>an IP address;</li>
							<li>has no TLD (e.g. localhost, local, etc.)</li>
							<li>the TLD or subdomain has a typical name (e.g. dev, test, local, stage, staging, etc.)</li>
							<li>is on a whitelist (e.g. *.staging.wpengine.com)</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>Subdomains and individual sites in a WP Multisite environment are considered different domains/sites and you need to purchase separate licenses for each domain/site where you use LayerSlider. The only exception is when you are not running different sites and purely use subdomains for localization or special landing pages within the same installation.</p>

					<h3 data-target="activation-purchase-code">Where is my Purchase Code?</h3>
					<p>You can find your Purchase Code in the email received upon the purchase. You can also download your license certificate from CodeCanyon at any time. Just navigate to your <a href="https://codecanyon.net/downloads?filter_by=codecanyon.net" target="_blank">Downloads page</a>, then find LayerSlider and choose the <mark>License certificate &amp; purchase code</mark> option from Download button. Your Purchase Code is inside the downloaded text file.</p>

					<h3 data-target="canceled-activation">Why was my activation canceled?</h3>
                    <p>Despite the first impression you may have, this banner only shows when your site wasn't actually activated. We're displaying it for the sake of consistency as "stuck" activations could result all sorts of strange symptoms like issues with updating the plugin and downloading templates. This is an automated error checking mechanism intended to notify you about this issue.</p>
                    <p>If you received a "LayerSlider product activation was canceled on this site" notification, please review all the potential issues that could cause this:</p>
                    <ul class="nomargin">
                    	<li>you've moved your site or your domain name has changed;</li>
                    	<li>you've remotely deactivated your site using our online tools or asked us to do the same on your behalf;</li>
                    	<li>you're using a non-genuine copy of LayerSlider</li>
                    	<li>your purchase have been refunded or the transaction disputed;</li>
                    	<li>Envato have revoked your purchase code with an undisclosed reason;</li>
                    	<li>your Envato account was temporarily disabled due to an ongoing <a target="_blank" href="https://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202501334-What-Is-A-Sales-Reversal-">sale reversal</a>;</li>
                    	<li>your Envato account has been terminated.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Please note, the exact circumstances might not have direct relation to LayerSlider or us, but caused by recent changes on your Envato account. In those cases, you should try re-activating the plugin after a few days when any ongoing dispute has been resolved.</p>
                    <p>If none of the above mentioned reasons can explain your case and you feel it happened mistakenly, please let us know by <a href="https://kreatura.ticksy.com">opening a support ticket</a>, so we can help you uncovering potential issues and restoring product activation.</p>
                    <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Please make sure that you're using the latest version of LayerSlider and try to re-activate your license with that version. Newer releases always include lots of bug fixes, so you can eliminate potential issues that might be relevant.</p>

					<h3 data-target="activation-transfer">How can I transfer licenses or deactivate past sites?</h3>
					<p></p>
					<h4>If you still have access for the site</h4>
					<p>Just click on the deactivate button in the Product Activation box and you are all set. The purchase code that you've used for that site will be available to activate other installations.</p>

						<figcaption>Deactivating your site</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p></p>

					<h4>If you no longer have access for the site</h4>
					<p>We've made an online utility where you can log in with your Envato account and list all your purchases and sites where you've activated LayerSlider. From there, you will be able to remotely deactivate any site you wish. Please visit: <a href="https://kreaturamedia.com/reset-activations/" target="_blank">https://kreaturamedia.com/reset-activations/</a></p>

					<h4>If you no longer have access to your Envato account or someone else purchased LayerSlider on your behalf</h4>
					<p>In cases like these, you should contact <a href="https://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank">Envato Support</a> and ask for help in order to restore your account or transfer purchases to another account. Since Envato is the operator of the Market, we cannot help you with account-related issues. However, we might be able to help with activation issues or providing purchase codes if you have conclusive proof that the purchase belongs to you.</p>


					<h3 data-target="activation-limitations">Limitations on license migration</h3>
					<p>
						To fight against piracy and other forms of misuse, our systems are monitoring for suspicious activities. Our ultimate goal is to have a great user experience, thus we've tuned our systems to only flag suspicious activities with a good reason.
					</p>
					<p>
						In case when our systems detect such activities associated with a purchase code, LayerSlider might prompt your for an activation approval. This does not mean that your license is no longer valid or you won't be able to use it for future activations. The approval process is mostly automated and a staff member from our Support Team will review your case as soon as possible with high priority.
					</p>
					<p class="nomargin">The usual patterns we're monitoring for include:</p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Unusually high number of activation attempts within a short time frame;</li>
						<li>Consistently reoccurring activation attempts on the same sites</li>
					</ul>


					<h3 data-target="activation-troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>You can't use your theme's purchase code in case if you've received LayerSlider bundled in a theme. For more information, please read the <a href="#activation-bundles">Theme bundles</a> section above.</li>
						<li>Please double check that you've entered your purchase code correctly if product activation doesn't accept it. Verify that you haven't accidentally included spaces or other surrounding text and characters.</li>
						<li>Rarely, a temporary outage in our/Envato services could also result in unrecognized purchase codes. Please try it again a little later.</li>
						<li>In some edge cases, servers might be configured in a way that prevents your installation from connecting to our server. Usual symptoms include <code>An unexpected error occurred</code> error messages. It's worth asking your web hosting company about this if you've ruled out other possibilities. Also, check the <code>LayerSlider -&gt; Options -&gt; System Status</code> screen to identify potential issues you might have on your site.</li>
						<li>If your activation was canceled, please refer to the <a href="#canceled-activation">Why was my activation canceled?</a> section.</li>
					</ul>

				<!-- Installing / Updating: Updating the plugin -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="updating">Updating the plugin</h1>
					<h3 data-target="updating-auto">Updating via Auto-Updates on activates sites</h3>
					<p>After activation, LayerSlider updates will automatically appear on your site in the same way as any other WordPress update. You can check if there is a new version available on the <code>Plugins</code> or <code>Dashboard</code> -&gt; <code>Updates</code> pages. A notification will also appear on the LayerSlider WP admin pages about new releases.</p>
					<p>To access early-access versions, select the beta release channel in the <mark>PRODUCT ACTIVATION</mark> box.</p>

						</div>
						<figcaption>Illustration of Auto-Updates and site activation settings</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<h3 data-target="updating-manual">Updating the plugin manually</h3>
					<p>Once you've downloaded the most recent version from your CodeCanyon downloads page you can deactivate and remove the old version, then install the new one. Your sliders and settings are in the database, removing the plugin won't touch them. You don't have to worry about losing your work, as keeping LayerSlider backward compatible is one of our top priorities, even for really old releases.</p>

					<h3>Updating the bundled version in themes</h3>
					<p>If you've received LayerSlider as a bundled item in your theme, new releases will be provided by the theme author through theme updates, since Auto-Updates won't work without activating your copy of LayerSlider. However, if you choose the purchase a license for LayerSlider, theme bundled versions can also be activated and updated without reinstalling the plugin.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Please note, WordPress checks for new updates periodically at certain times and caches the results. Even if there is a new version available, it might not appear immediately after activation.</li>

						<li>
							Our auto-update solution requires product activation and is only available for our direct customers as described in the <a href="#updating">Updating the plugin</a> section.
							<br><br>
							If you receive an <code>Update package not available</code> or similar error message during the update process it might a symptom of an interfering 3rd party theme/plugin. We are constantly notifying and working together with various authors whenever we notice such issue. Unfortunately, these issues cannot be fixed from our end and a temporary solution is <a href="#updating-manual">updating manually</a> or temporarily disabling other plugins and switching to the default WP theme.
							<br><br>
							Another possibility might be a stuck activation. If you've used our online tools to remotely deactivate a site (or asked us to do the same on your behalf) your site might no longer be activated. The same can be true if your purchase code has been revoked due to a refund or another reason. In cases like this deactivating your site and then immediately re-activating it can help.
						</li>
						<li>Keeping LayerSlider backwards compatible is one of our top priorities. However, there are times when major updates introduce new features and new settings, which depending on their defaults might alter your sliders a bit. If you experience any unwanted change, it's always a good idea to check the settings of your sliders, there are probably new options to control these changes.</li>

				<!-- Slider Groups -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="slider-groups">Slider Groups</h1>
					<p>Since LayerSlider 6.9.0, you can group sliders. This feature allows you to basically have folders for your sliders. You can create custom groups by dragging a slider and dropping it on another. There's also a new bulk action to group selected sliders together in a single step. You can remove sliders from a group with the same principle: just start dragging a slider, and drop it on the remove tile.</p>
					<p>When you import multiple sliders, either with a ZIP file or by downloading slider packs from the Template Store, they will be automatically grouped together. The Clear & Remove Group button allows you to immediately break up the grouping and have all sliders moved outside of the group. This won't touch your sliders and they will remain available on the main grid.</p>
					<p><strong>This feature only works in the Grid View at the moment.</strong> The list view displays sliders without grouping and you won't notice anything different, even if some sliders are in a group.</p>

					<h1 data-target="demo-sliders">Importing slider templates</h1>
					<p>Press the <code><i class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></i> Templates Store</code> button located before your list of sliders, to reveal the template store screen.</p>
					<p>Importing templates will allow you to see our settings and get familiar with the plugin. You can find both simple and complex sliders to discover LayerSlider's capabilities. You can freely experiment on these sliders without worrying since you can always import a new, untouched copy.</p>
					<p>Premium slider templates are particularly useful as a starting point for your future projects. We're releasing and updating premium templates regularly. Our goal is to cover most use cases, whether you need a slider for personal use (such as slideshow for family photos), or you want to use it on your business website, or even on billboards. Our selection includes great examples for retail shops as well as templates for creative work.</p>

				<!-- Getting Started: Using Google Fonts -->

					<h1 data-target="google-fonts">Using Google Fonts</h1>
					<p>LayerSlider can load custom fonts hosted by Google on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">fonts.google.com</a>. Select LayerSlider -> Options from your WordPress admin sidebar, then choose the Google Fonts tab to find the corresponding section. Custom fonts loaded with the editor will be automatically added to the pre-defined fonts you can choose from in the Slider Builder.</p>

					<h3>Character set support</h3>
					<p>By default, LayerSlider uses Latin characters for added Google Fonts. However, it supports Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Khmer and Vietnamese scripts as well.</p>

					<h3>Themes with Google Fonts support</h3>
					<p>Many WordPress themes support Google Fonts. However, it's common that they only load them on the front-end pages and they will appear incorrectly when you would build a slider on the admin interface. To workaround this issue just add them in LayerSlider and check the "Load only on admin interface" option. This way you can avoid loading the same font multiple times on the front-end pages.</p>

				<!-- Using the Slider Builder: Overview -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="builder-overview">Getting started with the slider builder</h1>
					<p>Since LayerSlider allows you building professional grade animated material, its slider builder interface can be a bit overwhelming at first. There are many options to control every aspect of your content. This is why it is important to take time and try to understand the basics with the following tips:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><mark>Read the tooltips:</mark> Almost everything on the admin interface reveal further information with tooltips. Just move your mouse cursor over option fields, buttons, and other interface elements, and the exact description of those will appear in a tooltip message.</li>
						<li><mark>Use the preview mode:</mark> By pressing the Preview button you can see your work in action instantly. Don't be shy to change settings. If you're not sure about how an option works exactly, just change it and observe the differences in the preview mode. When previewing a layer, you can change the content and settings on the fly, and see the changes instantly, without the need to jump in and out of preview every time something changes.</li>
						<li><mark>Use slider templates:</mark> Discussed under <a href="#demo-sliders">Gettings Started / Importing slider templates</a>, you can see how we built our demo sliders and which settings we used to achieve certain animations. You can find both simple and complex sliders to discover LayerSlider's capabilities. Don't be afraid of making changes on these samples, you can always import a fresh copy at any time. Premium slider templates can also be the starting point of your projects since we're focusing on covering most use cases.</li>
					</ul>

				<!-- Using the Slider Builder: Slider settings -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="builder-slider-settings">Slider settings</h1>
					<p>This is the page where LayerSlider navigates you after adding a new slider. On this screen you can set common settings like the size of the slider, and customize its appearance or features in the other sub-sections.</p>
					<p>We do not provide an extensive list of settings here since every option has its description displayed on the admin interface. Please review them carefully, so you can customize your slider behavior and appearance in the way you like. </p>

				<!-- Using the Slider Builder: Slide defaults -->
				<h2 data-target="builder-slide-defaults">Slide defaults</h2>
				<p>When you will work with slides and layer, you may notice that some option can inherit values from higher up the hierarchy. Layers can inherit option values from slides, and in the same manner, slides can inherit values from slider-wide global options. This gives you an opportunity to have a master switch to control certain settings. For example, instead of setting the sizing mode for each slide background one by one, you can just leave them on the value <code>inherit</code>, then set only one option in slider settings. We're using the inherit value by default for the options where it makes sense, so you don't have to bother with that. Just keep in mind that you can control some options from a central place.</p>

					<h2 data-target="builder-slide-transitions">About slide transitions</h2>
					<p>LayerSlider offers more than 200 pre-defined 2D/3D slide transitions. By using the <a href="#transition-builder">Transition Builder</a> it can be easily extended with custom ones for your own needs. Slide transitions will only use the background image of slides since web standards don't offer a way to "capture" all contents within a slider. It's important to keep in mind that layers will not be used for slide transitions, even if they made to look like a background image.</p>
					<p>Modern web browsers are required for 3D transitions to work properly. If you select any 3D transition, LayerSlider will prioritize them over 2D ones. The plugin has multiple fall-back levels whenever a visitor's machine is not capable of showing certain transitions. In general, 2D transitions are supported on all major web browsers.</p>


					<h2 data-target="builder-slide-linking">Linking slides</h2>
					<p>Linking a slide will make its entire surface clickable. You can also link layers to add a button or a smaller control. Based on your settings, layers can be either above or below of the slide link, making it possible to link both.</p>

					<p>Click on the <code>insert...</code> button and use the <code>Choose Page or Post</code> option if you want to link a WordPress resource like a page, post or attachment on your site. This way URLs will be generated automatically and point to the right place even if you change permalinks. It's also the way to use localization plugins like WPML where URLs might change according to the selected language.</p>

					<h3>Smart links</h3>
					<p>Smart links can control the slideshow, media playback and other aspects of sliders. It's an easy way to trigger certain slider actions when clicking on the linked element. It can be used for something small and trivial like adding a custom "stop" button up to building your navigation area replacement with your own customizations.</p>

					<p>Just click into the linking field and you will be presented with a list of available slider actions. There is only one action that might require some explanation: switching slides. You can achieve that by entering a hash tag (#) followed by the slide number that you want to jump to. For example, if you want to jump to the third slide, you need to enter <code>#3</code> into the linking filed.</p>


					<h3>Deeplink</h3>
					<p>A deeplink is a slide alias name, which you can use in your URLs with a hash tag so LayerSlider will start with the corresponding slide when visitors arrive to the page. Example: <code>domain.com/page/#welcome</code></p>
					<p>Use only lowercase alphanumeric values. You can also use this feature to implement slide navigation with links.</p>

					<h2 data-target="builder-layer-media">Embedding videos</h2>
					<p>LayerSlider supports YouTube, Vimeo, and self-hosted HTLM5 video/audio out of the box. We've integrated many features for these solutions such as setting autoplay, preview image, volume and other controls. They will also automatically pause and resume the slideshow while playing.</p>
					<p>Just choose the <code>Video / Audio</code> layer type to embed multimedia contents. For YouTube and Vimeo videos you need to paste the embed code from their website into the text field. Otherwise, click on the <code>Add Media</code> button to add self-hosted HTML5 video or audio.</p>

					<p>To use HTML5 self-hosted video/audio, please make sure you're using supported media formats <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats#Browser_compatibility" target="_blank">described here</a>. We recommend using <mark>MP3</mark> or <mark>AAC in MP4</mark> for audio, and <mark>VP8+Vorbis in WebM</mark> or <mark>H.264+MP3/AAC in MP4</mark> for video. The supported formats may vary between browsers, but you can also provide multiple formats if needed by holding down the Ctrl/Cmd key and selecting multiple items from your WordPress Media Library.</p>

					<p>At the moment we do not support other media players out of the box since those solutions have their own distinct APIs to control media playback. However, users with web development experience can use the <a href="#layerslider-api">LayerSlider API</a> to detect slider events and run custom code to control 3rd party media players.</p>

					<h2 data-target="builder-layer-shortcode">Using WP shortcodes and interactive content</h2>
					<p>Make sure you add WP shortcodes or other interactive content (such as Google Maps embeds, custom scripts, etc) to an <code>HTML</code> layer. Shortcodes will only be rendered on front-end pages, so don't be afraid if the slider builder interface doesn't show the result you would expect.</p>
					<p>Using interactive content highly relying on Javascript can be problematic, and might not work properly. Since we cannot workaround every possible issue in someone else's code, it's possible that some shortcodes and embed will be broken.</p>
					<p>It also worth mentioning that in responsive mode LayerSlider only scales the layer element itself to gain extra performance. The content inside should adapt the dimension changes on its own. While this happens automatically in most cases, shortcodes and complex HTML might not be resized in sync with the slider.</p>


					<h2 data-target="builder-layer-transitions">Layer transitions</h2>
					<p>This is where you can build your layer transitions. This section can be daunting at first since LayerSlider offers many options to customize every aspect of your work. However, everyone can learn it quickly and easily by following the tips already mentioned previously:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<mark>Read the tooltips:</mark>
							Almost everything on the admin interface reveal further information with tooltips. Just move your mouse cursor over option fields, buttons, and other interface elements, and the exact description of those will appear in a tooltip message.
						</li>
						<li>
							<mark>Use the preview mode:</mark>
							By pressing the Preview button you can see your work in action instantly. Don't be shy to change settings. If you're not sure about how an option works exactly, just change it and observe the differences in the preview mode. When previewing a layer, you can change the content and settings on the fly, and see the changes instantly, without the need to jump in and out of preview every time something changes.
						</li>
						<li>
							<mark>Use slider templates:</mark>
							Discussed under <a href="#demo-sliders">Getting Started / Importing slider templates</a>, you can see how we built our demo sliders and which settings we used to achieve certain animations. You can find both simple and complex sliders to discover LayerSlider's capabilities. Don't be afraid of making changes on these samples, you can always import a fresh copy at any time. Premium slider templates can also be the starting point of your projects since we're focusing on covering most use cases.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>There are multiple types of animation, you can view one at the time by clicking on its title or icon. In each section, you can find the description of what it does and when it will be used. For clarity, we've made animated illustrations that you can see by hovering over the icons. The green highlight shows which transition types are being used by the layer, while the scaled (larger) icon shows the currently opened transition section.</p>

						<figcaption class="zigzag">Illustration of layer transition options</figcaption>
					</figure>


					<h2 data-target="builder-layer-linking">Linking layers</h2>
					<p>You can link a layer under its <code>Link &amp; Attributes</code> tab. Enter a URL and set whether you want to open it on the current page or in a new tab/window.</p>

					<p>Click on the <code>Choose Page or Post</code> button if you want to link a WordPress resource like a page, post or attachment on your site. This way URLs will be generated automatically and point to the right place even if you change permalinks. It's also the way to use localization plugins like WPML where URLs might change according to the selected language</p>

					<h3>Smart links</h3>
					<p>Smart links can control the slideshow, media playback and other aspects of sliders. It's an easy way to trigger certain slider actions when clicking on the linked element. It can be used for something small and trivial like adding a custom "stop" button up to building your navigation area replacement with your own customizations.</p>

					<p>Just click into the linking field and you will be presented with a list of available slider actions. There is only one action that might require some explanation: switching slides. You can achieve that by entering a hash tag (#) followed by the slide number that you want to jump to. For example, if you want to jump to the third slide, you need to enter <code>#3</code> into the linking filed.</p>


					<h2 data-target="builder-layer-attributes">Layer attributes</h2>
					<p>You can also apply commonly used attributes (such as a unique ID or classes) on layers in the same section. These settings are made for users with web development experience who want to use custom coding to achieve a customization level that a visual editor cannot provide.</p>
					<p>Apart from the pre-defined list of attributes, it's also possible to add your own. In the custom attributes section, you can enter any attribute name, including pre-defined ones to override them. Many 3rd party plugin uses custom attributes, this section is important if for example you would like to <a href="#third-party-fancybox">set up a FancyBox image gallery</a> on LayerSlider layers.</p>


					<h2 data-target="builder-layer-styles">Layer Styles</h2>
					<p>Under the <code>Styles</code> tab of your layers, you can find commonly used formatting options to customize their appearance. We highly recommend using these settings whenever it's possible, instead of adding unnecessary HTML code to the contents of layers.</p>
					<p>This is where you can also set the position of layers with the <code>Left</code> and <code>Top</code> options. While you can use the visual editor to move layers around, it's often better to fine-tune them here for a pixel-perfect result.</p>

					<h1 data-target="builder-image-editor">Image editor</h1>
					<p>With the help of Adobe's Creative SDK, LayerSlider 6 now has a built-in image editor. You can perform common tasks like resizing, cropping, rotating images, as well as photo retouching, adding frames, text, effects, stickers and a lot more. It's like a mini-Photoshop.</p>
					<p>Look for the <img src="assets/img/pixie-logo.png" class="adobe-cc-logo"> icon on the upper left corner of any image picker button to launch the editor with the currently selected image.</p>

					<h1 data-target="builder-popout">Popout editor</h1>
					<p>One of the main design goals with LayerSlider 6 was the ability to work right in the preview area, without having to scroll up and down constantly to change settings. In addition to keyboard shortcuts, we've also added a <code><i class="dashicons dashicons-external"></i>Pop out editor</code> button, which will transform layer options into a floating window that can be resized and placed wherever you want. This makes it extremely easy to edit everything in one place.</p>

						</div>
						<figcaption class="zigzag">Illustration of dynamic layer settings</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>You can pull individual post information by using post placeholders. These are working very similarly to WordPress shortcodes. You can enter one or more placeholder into the layer's content area, then LayerSlider will automatically replace them with the appropriate content from posts. You can even mix them with static content. Example:</p>
					<p>
						This post was written by [author] on [date-published] will be<br>
						This post was written by admin on March 13, 2015
					</p>

					<h3>Using post filters</h3>
					<p>By using the post filters you can target certain WP posts or pages to pull information from. LayerSlider supports custom post types, tags, categories, and taxonimies to find literally any kind of custom content that themes and plugins may use. To set filters you just need select a dynamic layer and click on the <code>Configure post options</code> button. In the opened modal dialog window you can also order the results in your preferred way.</p>

					<h3>Get the items from results to work with</h3>
					<p>The post filters are global across slides, but you can select items from the results independently. This allows you to work with posts in a custom order, for example, you can retrieve only the even/odd posts from the results. If you want to follow the original order you can choose the option <code>following</code>, then LayerSlider will get them automatically.</p>

					<h3>Using mixed content</h3>
					<p>You are not forced to build sliders with dynamic contents only. You can mix them with static slides and layers.</p>

					<h3>Using custom post fields</h3>
					<p>You can use the <code>[meta:<i>fieldname</i>]</code> post placeholder to pull content from custom fields. Please make sure to replace the <mark>fieldname</mark> part with the actual field you want to pull information from.</p>

					<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Q: Can I use static and dynamic contents at once?</strong>
							<p>A: Sure, you can mix them freely. Just make sure to select the <code>Dynamic content from posts</code> layer type.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong>Q: Can I set custom [excerpt] for posts?</strong>
							<p>A: Yes, just enable the excerpt field under Screen Options when you're editing a post/page, then enter the desired content.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong>Q: How excerpts are generated?</strong>
							<ul class="nomargin" style="margin: 0;">
								<li>Manually entered excerpts will remain "as is", without any modification or formatting. Custom HTML code is allowed.</li>
								<li>Auto-generated excerpts have all shortcodes and HTML tags removed and they will appear as plain text.</li>
								<li>Auto-generated excerpts will be trimmed down to 55 words. The [...] "hellip" sign will be appended at the end if the text exceeds this limitation.</li>
								<li>Custom word count used by themes will be automatically applied in your sliders. Developers can override it by using filter hooks.</li>
								<li>Auto-generated excerpts respect WP's <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code> tag, so you can easily split your content at the point you want.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>


						<li>
							<strong>Q: Can I work with fixed posts?</strong>
							<p>A: No, the purpose of dynamic sliders is to automatically update their contents when you add a blog post or any other content on your site.

							<br><br>However, there is a simple workaround with a similar result. You can find specific posts with unique properties (e.g. custom tag) just by setting the right filters in the Post Options section of dynamic layers. The results will not update as long as you don't add more posts that match to the selected filters.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Q: Can I use content from multiple posts on the same slide?</strong>
							<p>A: At the moment you can't. This feature is yet to be added in a later update.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Q: Can I pull content made by WooCommerce or other plugins?</strong>
							<p>A: Yes, see the "Using custom post fields" part.</p>
						</li>

				<article>
					<h1 data-target="multilingual-sliders">Multilingual sliders</h1>
					<h2 data-target="multilingual-interface">How to translate the admin user interface?</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<strong>Download PoEdit</strong>
							<p>There are several apps available to help you with translating .PO files. PoEdit is a popular one, and it's available on every major platform. You can download it from <a href="http://www.poedit.net/download.php" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Start translating</strong>
							<p>Open the default LayerSlider-en_US.po file from your "/wp-content/plugins/LayerSlider/locales/" folder. When you save your work PoEdit will generate you a .MO file which will be needed to apply your work.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Name your files properly</strong>
							<p>WordPress recognizes your localization by a special formatting of file names. You will need to include the right <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_16.html#Language-Codes" target="_blank">language</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_16.html#Country-Codes" target="_blank">country</a> codes so it can identify what language your work is made for.</p>
							<p>For example, a French localization would have the file names: LayerSlider-fr_FR.po and LayerSlider-fr_FR.mo. You must follow this syntax, including the dash, underscore, and lower- or uppercase letters.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Apply your localization</strong>
							<p>Copy your newly created .PO and .MO files into the "/wp-content/plugins/LayerSlider/locales/" folder. WordPress should use them immediately if you named your files properly.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h2 data-target="multilingual-qtranslate">Creating multilingual sliders with qTranslate</h2>
					<p>qTranslate (and its successor, qTranslate X) is the one of the easiest way to create multilingual sliders in LayerSlider. It is a free and simple plugin that supports a shortcode-like syntax to enter text in multiple languages, so it can display the proper one for your visitors. LayerSlider supports shortcodes and other special syntaxes within the contents of layers, so you can enter something like this to create a multilingual slider:</p>
					<p><code>[:en]English text[:de]German text</code></p>
					<p>The line above will output "English text" if the visitor selected English page and "German text" if the visitor selected German. You can read more about qTranslate on its WP.org <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate-x/" target="_blank">plugin page</a>.</p>
					<div class="km-notification info cf">
						<span class="dashicons dashicons-info"></span>
						Don't forget to disable the "Use slider markup caching" option under the LayerSlider -> Options -> Advanced tab. Due to technical difficulties, it's not possible to dynamically show up multilingual content in a cached copy. Your sliders could always show the same language string if you keep caching enabled.
					</div>

					<h2 data-target="multilingual-wpml">Translating with the WPML plugin</h2>
					<p>You need the "Multilingual CMS" version of WPML with installed WPML String Translation add-on.</p>
					<h4>Translating the plugin's user interface:</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Navigate to WPML -&gt; Theme and plugins localization</li>
						<li>Make sure that the "Translate the theme and plugins using WPML's String Translation and load .mo files as backup" option is selected in the "Select how to translate strings in the theme and plugins" section. This should be the default selection in newer versions of WPML.</li>
						<li>In the "Strings in the plugins" section select LayerSlider and press the "Scan the selected plugins for strings" button below.</li>
						<li>Under WPML -&gt; String translation menu item, you can now see and edit the strings that the LayerSlider UI uses. This list might be cluttered with other translatable strings, so you might want to select the "LayerSlider" option in the "Domains" dropdown list.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Creating multilingual sliders:</h4>
					<p>LayerSlider registers translatable strings when you save your work. If you want to translate a previously created slider, you need to re-save it first, even if you don't change anything. Once LayerSlider registered the translatable items, they will appear under the WPML -&gt; String translation menu item in your WP admin sidebar.</p>
					<p>You can quickly filter the translatable items to your slider contents by selecting the "LayerSlider Sliders" (or "LayerSlider WP" if you're using an older version) option from the "Domain" dropdown list.</p>
					<p>After translating a string and marking it as complete, they will automatically appear in your front-end sliders. Whenever you make a change in your sliders, the affected strings will be marked as "Translation needs update" in WPML's String Translation module.</p>
					<p>The WPLM team was kind enough to provide an official step-by-step guide of translating LayerSlider sliders. It explains and illustrates every step of the way in detail. <a target="_blank" href="https://wpml.org/documentation/plugins-compatibility/creating-multilingual-sliders-using-layerslider-and-wpml/">Click here to read their guide.</a></p>

					<h1 data-target="builder-revisions">Slider revisions</h1>
					<p>LayerSlider 6.3.0 introduced a new premium feature: Revisions. Have a peace of mind knowing that your slider edits are always safe and you can revert back unwanted changes or faulty saves at any time. This feature serves not just as a backup solution, but a complete version control system where you can visually compare the changes you have made along the way.</p>
					<p>Reverting a slider to an earlier version adds another snapshot to Revisions, which can also be reverted if you change your mind and would rather return to the original copy.	Slider Revisions also saves the undo/redo controls. Even if there is no perfect snapshot, you will be able to undo the changes in-between to find what you are looking for.</p>

				<!-- Publishing sliders: Via Shortcode -->
				<article data-target="publish-shortcode">
					<h1>Method 1: Using shortcodes</h1>
					<p>Shortcodes are special placeholders, which you can paste into the WordPress text editor when editing posts and pages. They will be automatically replaced with the appropriate content on your front-end pages. Shortcodes are one of the most commonly used methods of inserting contents to your site. A lot of other solutions (e.g. page builders in themes) can also accept LayerSlider shortcodes to add sliders to your pages.</p>

					<p>Each slider has a unique shortcode. You can hover over a slider in your list and click on the <i class="dashicons dashicons dashicons-arrow-down-alt2"></i> icon to reveal slider actions, then select the <code><i class="dashicons dashicons-plus"></i> Embed</code> option to see its shortcode. You can also find the shortcode of a slider at the bottom of the Slider Builder page next to the save button.</p>

					<p>For advanced customization, you can add a <code>filters</code> attribute to your shortcode to control on which pages the slider should appear. Read the <a href="#publish-filters">Using filters</a> section to learn more. Example shortcode: <code>[layerslider id="1" filters="homepage"]</code></p>

					<p>There is also a way to override the "Starting slide" option with the shortcode. Using the <code>firstslide</code> shortcode parameter you can force embeded sliders to start with the specified slide, even if the slider has different settings. This is particularly useful when you want to embed the same slider in multiple times showing different slides. In the following example we're forcing the slider to start with the second slide: <code>[layerslider id="1" firstslide="2"]</code></p>
					<p>You can override most slider settings. Please read the <a href="#publish-overrides">Overriding settings</a> section for more information.</p>

					<h2 data-target="publish-shortcode-tool">Editor helper utility</h2>
					<p>We've also added a small utility to the WordPress text editor toolbar. It will pop up a modal window with your most recent sliders to choose from. After selecting the sliders and changing the embed options as desired, press the "Insert into post" button to put the corresponding shortcodes into the editor. See the illustrations below.</p>

				<!-- Publishing sliders: Gutenberg block -->
				<article data-target="publish-gutenberg">
					<h1>Method 2: Gutenberg block</h1>
					<p>Latest WordPress releases are shipped with their new page editor called Gutenberg. It's aimed to be an alternative for popular page builder solutions and offers WYSIWYG visual editing.</p>
					<p>LayerSlider now includes a dedicated Gutenberg block, which you can use to easily insert sliders into posts and pages. If you aren't familiar with Gutenberg yet, here's a quick tutorial:</p>
					<ol class="nomargin">
						<li>Click the <code>+</code> sign, then select the LayerSlider block from the Widgets category. You can also use the search feature to quickly find any block.</li>
						<li>The LayerSlider block is now automatically added to your post / page. You can select the block and move it around with the handle on the left side.</li>
						<li>At this point the block is only a placeholder showing where the slider would be displayed. Click on the <code>Slider Library</code> button and select the slider you want to insert into your post / page.</li>
						<li>That's it! You can now press the editor Publish / Update button to save your changes and the slider will be at the right place on your front-end pages.</li>
					</ol>

					<p>Additional details:</p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>To change the slider, you just need to select the LayerSlider block, then click on the pencil toolbar button located above the block.</li>
						<li>You can customize your LayerSlider block with extra options available at the right sidebar. If the sidebar isn't visible, just press the cog icon at the top right corner of the editor page.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Here's a quick video showing Gutenberg and the LayerSlider block in action:</p>

				</article>



				<!-- Publishing sliders: Via Widgets -->
				<article data-target="publish-widgets">
					<h1>Method 3: Using the LayerSlider widget</h1>
					<p>LayerSlider supports widgets, so you can add sliders to your front-end pages just by a drag n' drop. To do that, navigate to the Appearance menu on your left sidebar and select "Widgets". Grab the LayerSlider WP widget and drop it into one of your widget areas.</p>

					<p>Please note that some themes may not support a widget area that you're looking for. In this case, you can create a new widget area by editing your theme files. <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Widgetizing_Themes" target="_blank">Here</a> is the official documentation about widgetizing your theme. However, this requires web development knowledge and we don't recommend for users without experience.</p>

					<p>For advanced customization, you can enter custom filters in your widget settings to control on which pages the slider should appear. Read the <a href="#publish-filters">Using filters</a> section to learn more.</p>

					<p>By entering a custom value into the "Override starting slide" option field,  you can force embeded sliders to start with the specified slide, even if the slider has different settings. This is particularly useful when you want to embed the same slider in multiple times showing different slides.</p>

				<!-- Publishing sliders: Page Builders -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="publish-page-builders">Method 4: Page Builders, Visual Composer</h1>
					<p>Most page builders in themes support embedding LayerSlider sliders out of the box. Whether you're using a custom solution or a popular plugin like Visual Composer, there is likely a way to use them with LayerSlider.</p>
					<p>Either there is a dedicated module/block/widget for LayerSlider, or you can insert shortcodes in the same manner described in the first method.</p>
					<p>If you experience any issue, please review the available options your page builder offers. Since each solution differs in design and behavior, there is no universal guide to them. You can also consider just using more conventional methods like shortcodes and widgets described in method 1 and 2 respectively.</p>

				</article>


				<!-- Publishing sliders: With PHP function -->
				<article data-target="publish-php">
					<h1>Method 5: PHP function</h1>
					<p>Because a slider can be an integral part of your site, you may want to insert it dynamically from the template files. There is a PHP function (with additional filtering options) to do just that. For example, you can call it from the header.php file of your theme and it will insert your slider into the corresponding area. By providing filters you can show it on certain pages only depending on your settings. Here is the function definition:</p>
					<div>
						<code>layerslider ( mixed $sliderID [, string $filters [, array $overrides ] ] )</code><br>
						<ul>
							<li>The <code>$sliderID</code> parameter can be found in the list of your sliders on the LayerSlider admin area. See the first table column.</li>
							<li><code>$filters</code> is an optional filter list. Read the <a href="#publish-filters">Using filters</a> section to learn more.</li>
							<li><code>$overrides</code> is an array of slider settings to be applied to the inserted slider. Check the <a href="#publish-overrides">Overriding settings</a> section to learn more.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>The following examples are all valid:</p>
					<pre name="code" class="brush: php; highlight:10">
						&lt;?php layerslider(1); ?&gt; // Displays the first slider on every page
						&lt;?php layerslider(1, 'homepage'); ?&gt; // Displays the first slider only on your home page
						&lt;?php layerslider(1, 'my-custom-post-title'); ?&gt; // Displays the first slider on a custom page by name
						&lt;?php layerslider(2, '1369'); ?&gt; // Displays the second slider on a custom page by ID
						&lt;?php layerslider('homefullwidth', 'category-name'); ?&gt; // Displays the slider with the slug 'homefullwidth' on ali/custom page by a category name
						&lt;?php layerslider(3, 'homepage,about-us,1234'); ?&gt; // Displays the third slider on multiple pages</pre>
					<p>It is important to check the corresponding slider ID on the LayerSlider WP slider list page. When you remove some sliders, their IDs won't be re-indexed and the sequence you would expect may broke up. This is important for data consistency.</p>
				</article>


				<!-- Publishing sliders: Using filters -->
				<article data-target="publish-filters">
					<h1>Using filters to display sliders on specific pages</h1>
					<p>Filters can be used to target specific pages where you want a slider to be displayed. This can be extremely helpful if you're inserting sliders in a way that would show them on multiple pages. By using filters you can set custom conditions that would otherwise require programming skills. Our solution is easy to use for anyone and the currently supported filters should cover most use cases.</p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li><mark>Front Page:</mark> The special name <code>homepage</code> can be used to display the slider on your site's main page.</li>
						<li><mark>Page ID:</mark> Use a page ID to display sliders on a specific page. You can find the page ID in the URL (post=&lt;number&gt;) when you're editing a page/post on the WP admin area.</li>
						<li><mark>Page Slug:</mark> A page slug can also achieve the same purpose as page IDs. The page slug is the editable part of the permalink, which you can see when editing a page/post on the admin interface.</li>
						<li><mark>Category:</mark> You can also filter for category pages. Providing a category name will display the slider on all pages belonging to that category.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						<strong>Important:</strong> You can set multiple filters. Just provide a comma separated list if you want to display sliders on multiple pages. Mixing the different kinds of filters together or providing multiple IDs/slugs/category names is not a problem.
					</p>
					<p class="nomargin"><strong>Example:</strong> The filter list <code>homepage,about-us,1234</code> can be split into three different filters:</p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>homepage – your site's main/front page</li>
						<li>about-us – a page slug (permalink)</li>
						<li>1234 – a page ID if you don't use pretty URLs</li>
					</ul>
				</article>

				<!-- Publishing sliders: Using filters -->
				<article data-target="publish-overrides">
					<h1>Overriding slider settings</h1>
					<p>Version 6.8.0 and above allows you to override slider settings via the shortcode and the layerslider() PHP function. This can be useful if you want to make small changes in certain situations without duplicating the slider. For example, you might want to change the slider skin on some pages to fit better to a different page style. This can be achieved like so:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Shortcode:</strong><br>
							<code>[layerslider id="1" skin="borderlessdark"]</code>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>PHP function:</strong>
							<pre name="code" class="brush: php;">
&lt;?php layerslider( 1, '', array( 'skin' => 'borderlessdark' ) ); ?&gt;</pre>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Another example could be the starting slide. You might want to insert the same slider on multiple pages with a different opening:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Shortcode:</strong><br>
							<code>[layerslider id="1" firstslide="3"]</code>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>PHP function:</strong>
							<pre name="code" class="brush: php;">
&lt;?php layerslider( 1, '', array( 'firstslide' => 3 ) ); ?&gt;</pre>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<div class="km-notification info cf">
						<span class="dashicons dashicons-info"></span>
						You can tell the exact option names by inspecting the name attribute of the slider settings input fields. This might require some web development experience.

				<h2 data-target="popups-about">About Popups</h2>
				<p>LayerSlider is a well established product with many years of experience behind it. Combining our strong foundation and the vast number of features we already have with the newly introduced Popup plugin makes LayerSlider one of the best choice among popup plugins. All the features you would use in sliders are also available in Popups as well. This includes our feature rich image & content editor, multilingual popups, dynamic content from WP posts, and of course LayerSlider's animation capabilities.</p>

				<p>In addition, the LayerSlider Popup plugin comes with a variety of new options to fine tune the appearance and control when and how to display popups. Greet new visitors on your site with a beautifully designed animated banner with newsletter subscription or other offers. Display a message when they become idle. Show them recommended content before leaving the page or when they finished reading an article. There are a lot of possibilities and all of LayerSlider's content creation and animation capabilities are at your service to make popups that stand out from the crowd.</p>

				</figure>


				<h2 data-target="popups-embed">Embedding Popups</h2>
				<p>Popups can be embedded to your pages in the same way as traditional sliders. Any of the method described in <a href="#publishing-sliders">Publishing Sliders</a> will work. We're also providing a new method to fine tune how and when to display a Popup. See the next section to learn how to use the auto include feature.</p>


				<h2 data-target="popups-autoinclude">Using the auto include feature</h2>
				<p>Given the nature of Popups, you will likely want to include it on multiple pages with fine tuning when and to whom it should appear. Although conventional methods of including sliders will work the same, you will probably want to use the auto include feature dedicated specifically to Popups.</p>
				<div class="km-notification warning cf">
					<span class="dashicons dashicons-warning"></span>
					The features described below will only with the auto-include method. If you use other methods such as shortcodes, widgets, page builders or PHP functions the Popup will always appear.
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Choose your target pages:</strong>
						<span>In the Target Pages section you will be presented some pre-defined option to choose on which pages a Popup should appear. By turning the All pages switch off, more options will become available to choose where to include your Popup. By entering a comma separated list of page IDs, titles or slugs into the Include custom pages text field you can add individual pages. There is also an option to exclude pages in the same manner.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Choose your target audience:</strong>
						<span>Select the roles and user groups to whom you want to display the Popup. You have the option to show your work only for registered or unregistered users, or even to first time visitors for example.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Set up a repeat:</strong>
						<span>Disable the Repeat Popup option if you would like to show a Popup only once to a vistor. Enable the Repeat Popup option and leave the Repeat after # days option empty if you want to display the Popup on each page load. Alternatively, you can enter a value from 0 to 365 to repeat after the specified number of days has passed.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Fine tune your work:</strong>
						<span>Don't forget to check out the Launch Popup section to set up triggers to control when the Popup should become visible. You can also fine tune the appearance of other aspects of your Popup with the other settings we didn't mention here.</span>
					</li>
				</ul>


				<h2 data-target="popups-extras">Extras</h2>
				<p>As mentioned in the <a href="#builder-layer-linking">Linking layers</a> sections, the <code>#closepopup</code> Smart Link can be very helpful if you want to design your own close button with unique appearance and transitions. This option also available when linking the entire surface of slides.</p>
				<p>Alternatively, you can apply the <code>ls-close-popup-button</code> class name to any element within the slider to achieve the same goal.</p>
				<p>If you have multiple Popups on the same page, you might want a single button to close them all. In a case like that just apply the <code>ls-close-all-popups-button</code> class name on any element on the page.</p>


				<h2 data-target="publish-troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>My Popup doesn't show up:</strong>
						<span>Review the Launch Popup section and verify that you've set a trigger. Also check out the Repeat Control options. You might already saw the Popup previously and there isn't a proper repeat set up. Make sure that the Popup should be visible to you and on the page where you test it based on the Target Pages & Target Audience settings.<br><br>

						Furthermore, see if you've selected the Popup option under Slider Settings -> Layout. Popup is a premium feature, it also requires product activation if you haven't done it already.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>My Popup show up as a regular slider:</strong>
						<span>Make sure that you've selected the Popup option under Slider Settings -> Layout. Without that, your work will appear as regular sliders or not at all.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Can I use the same slider both as a Popup and regular slider?</strong>
						<span>No. Popups have different layout options that would make it really impractical. However, you can duplicate the slider slider and use slightly different settings if you are looking into a workaround.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>How can I use forms, email subscriptions, etc. in Popups?</strong>
						<span>Currently, LayerSlider does not offer form building or email subscription features. However, you can use 3rd party solutions for these kind of purposes. LayerSlider is shortcode aware, just create an HTML layer and paste the shortcode of any 3rd party plugin of your choosing. This enables you to combine and use the best of both worlds without compromising.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Do you track impressions and other statistics?</strong>
						<span>We're planning to introduce features like this in future updates. Until then you can embed custom HTML and WordPress shortcodes, so there shouldn't be an obstacle to use 3rd party solutions of your choosing.</span>

				<h1>Third-Party Integration Guides</h1>
				<h2 data-target="third-party-fancybox">Using FancyBox in sliders</h2>
				<p>FancyBox and other Lightbox-like plugins in general can be used to display almost any type of content in a modal window. Images, galleries, videos, other websites, pdfs, you name it. In our example we're demonstrating how to embed Google Maps, but you can use the same method to add other embeddable web services as well.</p>

				<h3>Setting up a Google Maps modal</h3>
				<ol class="nomargin">
					<li>First, you need to install a FancyBox WordPress plugin. In our guide we used <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-fancybox/" target="_blank">Easy FancyBox</a>.</li>
					<li>Make sure to review the Easy FancyBox plugin settings and enable to load videos and iframes.</li>
					<li>After setting up FancyBox, jump back to LayerSlider and select a layer in the editor that you want to use with FancyBox.</li>
					<li>Under the Link &amp; Attributes tab, enter the URL you want to display with Fancybox, then enter the <code>fancybox-iframe</code> into the <code>class</code> field in the custom attributes section.</li>
					<li>That's it, FancyBox should now appear when you click on the layer on your front-end pages.</li>
				</ol>

					<figcaption class="zigzag">Example of setting up a Google Maps modal with the Easy FancyBox plugin in a LayerSlider slider</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h3>Other use cases</h3>
				<p>Of course, FancyBox offers a lot more. You can also make image galleries or embed YouTube videos for example. All of these can be done by applying the appropriate class name and other special attributes described in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-fancybox/faq/" target="_blank">Easy Fancybox documentation</a>.</p>

				<p>For example, To group multiple layers into one gallery, enter the same <code>rel</code> name on all layers. It can be a custom identifier of your choosing. For example: <mark>flowers-gallery</mark>.</p>

				<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
				<p>If you experience any issue, please verify that you've installed and activated the Easy FancyBox plugin, and you've reviewed all of its settings to allow the functionally you're seeking. For example, if you want to embed web contents, you need to allow <mark>iframes</mark>.</p>

				<h1>More guides are coming soon</h1>
				<p>Based on requests and popular demand, we will continue to include more and more integration guides to use LayerSlider with your favorites.</p>

				<!-- Advanced Customization: Transition Builder -->
				<article>

					<h1 data-target="transition-builder">Using the Transition Builder</h1>
					<p>LayerSlider WP supports various types of slide transitions. The Transition Builder offers you an easy-to-use visual editor to create custom transitions for your own needs. Transitions created with the editor will automatically appear in the list of available transitions when you're editing a slider.</p>

					<h3>Tips &amp; tricks</h3>
					<p>We can recommend the same tips as we mentioned in the Slider Builder section:</p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Hover over an option field with your mouse cursor to reveal more information.</li>
						<li>Watch the preview. The best way to learn is to instantly see how each option affect the transition you're building. Just play with the settings and observe the differences to understand their role.</li>
						<li>We have sample transitions, too! They should be already added to the Transition Builder when you first visit the page. You can see the settings we've used to build these samples. You can also import any of the 200+ pre-defined 2D/3D transitions we're using in the plugin.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Building 3D transitions</h3>
					<p>3D transitions are made up with 3 animation steps to create more complex transitions with multiple actions. The "animation" step is required, but the "before animation" and "after animation" steps are optional. You can use them to do some preparation before the animation starts or restore back some settings after it is finished.</p>

					<p>To help you better understand what are these steps, here is a simple example:</p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Before the animation starts, you may want to scale down columns</li>
						<li>Then rotate them to left</li>
						<li>Finally, you want them to scale up back</li>
					</ul>


					<p>If you want a really simple transition, you don't have to use all the steps. In this case, please make sure to untick the "Enabled" checkboxes for the corresponding steps.</p>

				<!-- Advanced Customization: Skin Editor -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="skin-editor">About LayerSlider WP Skin Editor</h1>

					<p>The LayerSlider WP skin editor offers you a graphical way on your WP admin area to modify LayerSlider skins without the need to work with files on FTP. The Skin Editor automatically detects additional content, so you can customize skins from other sources as well.</p>

					<div class="km-notification info cf">
						<span class="dashicons dashicons-info"></span>
						Editing a skin requires some basic CSS knowledge, please do not attempt to modify a skin if you aren't familiar with CSS. Malformed or invalid CSS code can break your slider appearance.
					</div>

					<div class="km-notification warning">
						<span class="dashicons dashicons-warning"></span>
						Please note, updating the plugin (including auto-updates) will override the plugin folder along with your modifications. Consider using the <a href="#css-editor">CSS Editor</a> or back-up your modifications before updating.
					</div>
				</article>

				<!-- Advanced Customization: CSS Editor -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="css-editor">About LayerSlider WP CSS Editor</h1>

					<p>With this editor, you can enter custom CSS code, which will be included on pages containing LayerSlider sliders. This gives you a chance for much more complex customizations that the Slider Builder interface cannot provide. Your CSS code will also be included in the Slider Builder, thus the Preview mode should pick them up and show the appropriate result on-the-fly.</p>

					<div class="km-notification info cf">
						<span class="dashicons dashicons-info"></span>
						Using CSS requires some web development experience. Please do not attempt to use this editor if you're not familiar with CSS. Malformed or invalid CSS code can break the appearance of sliders or your site.
					</div>
				</article>


				<!-- Advanced Customization: LayerSlider API -->
				<article>

					<h1 data-target="layerslider-api">About LayerSlider API</h1>
					<p>LayerSlider is built on standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and offers a way to extend the capabilities of the plugin through the LayerSlider API. Please note, this requires programming skills and web development experience, thus we cannot recommend it to users without the necessary knowledge.</p>

					<div class="km-notification info cf">
						<span class="dashicons dashicons-info"></span>
						LayerSlider 6 introduced a whole new API model with new events and methods. To view the API documentation for older releases, please navigate to the <a href="#legacy-api">Legacy API</a> section. The legacy API cannot be used in LayerSlider 6, it is documented only to provide you a way of porting (if needed).

					<h2 data-target="api-events">Event reference</h2>
					<p>Event callbacks is a way to receive notifications and run custom code when certain actions occur in sliders. The following events can be used under the <code>Event Callbacks</code> tab of the Slider Builder.</p>

					<h2 data-target="api-event-data">Event Data object</h2>
					<p>Most event handler functions will have the same 2 pre-defined variables passed. Those are the jQuery Event object and our custom slider data object. You can name these variables by your choice, but we will refer to them as <code>event</code> and <code>slider</code> in our examples.</p>

					<p>Every <code>slider</code> data object will  contain the same properties, regardless of the used event. However, it's possible that some values are not yet set depending on the current point of execution. The data object contains the most relevant information, but we've also included the entire LayerSlider instance data source, which you can use to access or modify properties on the fly, as well as to add new methods to implement new features.</p>

					<p>We encourage everyone to use the browser developer tools and examine the returned data by using console.log() to see potentially undocumented data. Here is an example that you can paste into your browser's JavaScript console. Please make sure to use the right selector when targeting the slider container element on which the LayerSlider instance was created.</p>

					<pre name="code" class="brush: js">
					var data = jQuery('#slider').layerSlider('eventData');
					console.log( data );</pre><br><br>

					<div class="km-notification info">
						<span class="dashicons dashicons-info"></span>

				<h1 data-target="troubleshooting-reporting">Before reporting an issue</h1>
				<p>There are some common practices you should try before reporting an issue:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Check System Status</strong><br>
						Select <code>LayerSlider -> Options</code> from your WordPress admin sidebar, then click on the <code>System Status</code> button. The page displayed there is intended to help you identifying common issues and to display relevant debug information about your site. Always try the recommendations provided by this menu (if any) before reporting an issue.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Always use the latest software versions!</strong><br> This includes your WordPress installation, LayerSlider, the WP theme you're using and any other plugin installed on your site. Third party plugins and themes (not hosted on wordpress.org) may not update automatically. Taking care to keep everything up-to-date can spare you from a lot of problems and frustration.</li>
					<li><strong>Try to find the source of the problem!</strong><br> Issues could be related to other plugins/themes and their settings. We often ask our customers to temporarily disable other plugins and switch to one of the default WP themes. This way we can verify that the issue is related to LayerSlider, and is not an incompatibility with another item. If it solves the problem, you can find which item caused the trouble by re-enabling them one-by-one and watching when the issue comes back.</li>
					<li><strong>Try to find a solution!</strong><br> A lot of times issues occur due to incorrect settings or other environmental factors. It's always a good idea to quickly review your settings and try to find a solution in the documentation or online by searching through our <a href="https://support.kreaturamedia.com/faq/4/layerslider-for-wordpress/" target="_blank">FAQs</a>, the <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/layerslider-responsive-wordpress-slider-plugin-/1362246/comments" target="_blank">comments section</a> and the guides below.</li>

									<br><br>
									Also, make sure that your web server meets the plugin requirements: PHP 5.3 or newer, PHP Multibyte String Extension, WordPress 3.5 or newer.
									Contact with your web hosting company to make the necessary changes if it's required.

									<strong>Quick Fix:</strong> Try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ssl-insecure-content-fixer/" target="_blank">SSL Insecure Content Fixer</a> plugin, it should help in most cases.
									<br><br>

									Any part of your site can be responsible for HTTPS mixed / insecure content issues. To have a better understanding about what causing this issue, please read and follow the guide provided by Google on this matter by <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/fixing-mixed-content?hl=en" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.
									<br><br>

									Navigate to <code>Settings -> General</code> on your WP admin area and verify that both the <mark>WordPress Address</mark> and <mark>Site Address</mark> fields are containing the right URL with the https protocol included.
									<br><br>

									Please note, as <a href="https://snippets.webaware.com.au/snippets/wordpress-is_ssl-doesnt-work-behind-some-load-balancers/" target="_blank">this post</a> mentions, load balancers, proxies, and other network-related solutions and services may cause WordPress to not recognize the correct protocol. LayerSlider uses native WP functions to generate URLs, thus in many cases it is a site/server-related issue that can easily affect other assets on your site.

					<h1>What's new?</h1>

					<h3>Changes in LayerSlider 6.9.2</h3>
					<p></p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Fixed an issue that prevented displaying sliders properly under hidden areas such as tabs in very rare circumstances.</li>
						<li>Various improvements for PlayByScroll sliders making the whole experience much smoother.</li>
						<li>Updated the bundled GreenSock animation engine library, which can provide increased performance in certain cases and take advantage of any new features that modern web standards offer.</li>
						<li>We've implemented a workaround in GreenSock to fix an issue caused by certain 3rd party solutions that resulted in a broken admin interface.</li>
					</ul>


					<h3>Changes in LayerSlider 6.9.1</h3>
					<p></p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Fixed an issue with the Gutenberg editor block that caused your sliders not always displaying on the front-end pages.</li>
						<li>Improved the LayerSlider News section to prevent caching, so it always shows the latest releases.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Changes in LayerSlider 6.9.0</h3>
					<p></p>

					<h4>Localization</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Ласкаво просимо! Thanks to Igor R., LayerSlider is now fully translated into Ukrainian.</li>
						<li>Several UI changes to handle longer words and phrases in foreign languages.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Slider Groups</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>LayerSlider now supports Slider Groups, which are basically folders for your sliders.</li>
						<li>Importing multiple sliders or downloading slider packs from the Template Store now automatically groups them together.</li>
						<li>You can freely create your own slider groups by dragging a slider and dropping it on another. Removing sliders from groups follows the same principle.</li>
						<li>There's a new bulk action to group selected sliders together in a single step.</li>
						<li>Slider Groups is only available in the Grid View at the moment. The list view displays sliders without grouping and you won't notice anything different than it used to be, even if some sliders are in a group.</li>
						<li>Gutenberg may not be perfect just yet, but it's the future of WordPress editing. Thus Slider Groups is available in the Gutenberg block, but not in the TinyMCE classic editor.</li>
						<li><b>DEVELOPERS: </b> Make sure to check out the <a href="developers.html#sliders">Working with sliders</a> section in the developer documentation to be sure you're compatible with the new Slider Groups feature. There's also a new and very easy way to implement slider pickers with minimal coding via the <a href="developers.html#slider-library-api">LS_SliderLibrary</a> JS API.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Interface refresh</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>LayerSlider has a new logo and a slightly different branding.</li>
						<li>The sliders Grid View has a much more modern design with all sorts of tweaks.</li>
						<li>You can now also select sliders in the grid view by holding Ctrl/Cmd and clicking on them. Slider selection also has a somewhat changed look and feel.</li>
						<li>Every modal window has been rebuilt. They're faster, more modern looking, respond to keyboard shortcuts, most of them is now responsive, and contains slight UI tweaks for your convenience.</li>
						<li>You can now instantly import sliders just by dropping files on the Import Sliders tile.</li>
						<li>A new welcome/about screen that also includes GDPR settings.</li>
						<li>Removed several annoying or obstructive modal windows like the share sheet of the GDPR settings for first time users.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Other new features</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Layers can now have background images. The relevant settings can be found under the Style tab in the newly added Background section.</li>
						<li>Added new layer style option to prevent mouse events.</li>
						<li>Added WooCommerce 'Customer' role for the Popup Target Audience settings.</li>
						<li>LayerSlider -> Options -> Advanced now includes an option to suppress debug information.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Misc</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Export files now have formatted file names, including the name of slider, so it's easer to find the one you're looking for.</li>
						<li>Fixed audio file selection issue in case of media layers.</li>
						<li>Fixed an issue that prevented loading your images in very rare circumstances.</li>
						<li>Fixed known issues embedding private/unlisted Vimeo videos.</li>
						<li>Way too much small interface tweaks and other kinds of fixes.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Changes in LayerSlider 6.8.4</h3>
					<p></p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>WordPress 5.2 introduced changes to server requirements that may prevent some users updating to the latest WP releases. LayerSlider will not follow this change in the foreseeable future and is fully compatible with both new and older WP releases.</li>
						<li>Changes in browser implementation of autoplay policies now allow us to display the Unmute button introduced in v6.8.0 for all supported media sources and in all browsers.</li>
						<li>Countless media playback improvements and fixes.</li>
						<li>Fixed the stretched/distorted background image issue that affected some users mostly with zoomed-in browser settings.</li>
						<li>The "Enhanced lazy load" advanced option now also takes care of the 'srcset' attribute to prevent any unwanted network traffic.</li>
						<li>Many other improvements and fixes under the hood.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Changes in LayerSlider 6.8.3</h3>
					<p></p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>The new WordPress editing experience is here and LayerSlider provides a full-fledged Gutenberg block for your convenience. The helper utility for the Classic Editor remains available, so you can easily insert sliders no matter what page builder do you prefer.</li>
						<li>LayerSlider -> Options -> Advanced now offers settings to disable editor extensions.</li>
						<li>Added [author-avatar] post placeholder for Dynamic Layers.</li>
						<li>Deeplinks can now be used for back and forth navigation instead of just starting the slider with a specific slide.</li>
						<li>Improved support for Vimeo videos</li>
						<li>Fixed minor media playback issues</li>
						<li>Minor UI changes</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Changes in LayerSlider 6.8.2</h3>
					<p></p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Added the Pixie Image Editor by <a href="https://codecanyon.net/user/vebto" target="_blank">Vebto</a>. This is a replacement for the Adobe Image Editor SDK that was removed from the last release due to its end-of-life.</li>
						<li>Huge file optimizations. This updates makes sure that every resource is as compact as it can be, so you and your visitors can save bandwidth and server resources.</li>
						<li>This update also comes with a horde of small bug fixes and improvements, focusing on stability, performance and aesthetics.</li>
						<li>Some small UI changes for usability purposes.</li>
						<li>Fixed media playback issues with static layers.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Changes in LayerSlider 6.8.1</h3>
					<p></p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Fixed an issue with embedded media on secure (HTTPS) sites that we caught right after releasing the previous update.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Changes in LayerSlider 6.8.0</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>We're back! Although you didn't hear from us for a while, we're still actively working on LayerSlider. In fact, we have some big announcements coming soon. Stay tuned!</p>
					<p>In the meantime, here is an update that we planned to release much earlier. We're very sorry about the delay. Future updates will now arrive at the usual rate.</p>

					<h4>A complete media handling overhaul</h4>
					<p>Anything media related in LayerSlider has been rewritten from scratch.</p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>We're now using newer APIs that should be more reliable and should eliminate strange edge cases.</li>
						<li>Custom embed options specified in the URL is now 100% tracked and recognized by LayerSlider.</li>
						<li>A new media option <code>loop</code> was added for media layers.</li>
						<li>Introduced the <code>muted</code> setting for media layers. A special option called <code>Offer to unmute</code> is there, so you can provide a non-intrusive experience to your visitors by offering a special button to easily restore sound on an otherwise muted video.</li>
						<li>Improved compatibility with media autoplay policies. Some web browsers might prevent video/audio layers to be autoplayed <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes#new-behaviors" target="_blank">based on a number of different factors</a>. Muted autoplay is always allowed. This new update now falls back gracefully and plays the media muted whenever the restrictions would apply. In cases when media should have been autoplayed with sound, we're offering an easy way for page visitors to restore sound with a click of a button.</li>
						<li>The slideshow will no longer wait indefinitely for a paused media to finish. After pausing media playback the slider will wait a few extra seconds, but it will eventually continue the slideshow if all animations on the slide has completed and the slider wants to switch slides.</li>
						<li>Other significant improvements for media handling, especially for mobile and tablet devices.</li>
						<li>New smart links (LayerSlider Action) to manage media playback: play, pause & unmute. </li>
						<li>New API commands: playMedia, pauseMedia & unmuteMedia</li>
						<li>
							New API events: mediaDidStart, mediaDidStop
							<br><br>
						</li>
						<li><i>PS: The new unmute button offered to easily restore sound may not always be visible for embedded players (i.e. YouTube and Vimeo). Browser support varies and we expect them to support delegating autoplay permission to embedded players in the near future. HTML5 self-hosted videos are working as expected in all browsers.</i></li>

					</ul>


					<h4>New features</h4>
					<ul>

						<li>You can now override slider settings via the shortcode or the PHP function. It can be useful if you want to make small changes to the same slider in certain situations without having duplicates. For example, you might want to change the slider skin on some pages to fit better to a different page style. Check the <a href="#publish-overrides">Overriding settings</a> section for more information.</li>


					</ul>

					<h4>Improvements</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>This update improves the reliability of our online services. Serving plugin updates, downloading templates and other online features should now work even in very unusual server environments.</li>

					</ul>

					<h4>Other</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>The Adobe Image Editor was removed due to its end-of-life. A replacement solution will be added very soon in another update.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Bug fixes</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Fixed qTranslate compatibility that affected sliders inserted by certain page builders in some cases.</li>
						<li>Fixed an issue that affected Popup sliders when used with the Origami slide transition.</li>
						<li>Fixed the <code>reverseSlide</code> API method not properly replaying the slide when the second parameter was present.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Changes in LayerSlider 6.7.5</h3>
					<p>This release focuses on plugin-wide improvements and bug fixes including lots of less visible changes to enhance compatibility and stability.</p>

					<h4>Improvements</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Greatly improved Play By Scroll feature, which now works as expected if a slider covers the entire page or located at unusual places.</li>
						<li>Improvements to HTTPS secure sites to overcome some edge cases that might affected certain sites very rarely.</li>
						<li>Improvements to script loading and handling, which provides extended compatibility with CDNs and JS minify/combine features commonly used in themes and cache plugins.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Bug fixes</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Fixed pre 5.3 PHP parsing errors.</li>
						<li>Fixed date localization in dynamic posts.</li>
						<li>The Popup click trigger now prevents navigating away from page if it's set on a linked element.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Other changes</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Theme authors now have the ability to enforce certain settings located under LayerSlider -> Options -> Advanced in order to maximize theme compatibility.</li>
						<li>Removed the "Put JS includes to body" advanced setting. The "Include scripts in the footer" option should be used as an alternative.</li>
						<li>Lots of under the hood improvements and bug fixes.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Known issues</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Chrome 66's Autoplay Policy Change: Google introduced new browser restrictions, which will prevent automatic video/audio playback in certain situations. Autoplay is now allowed only when either the media won't play sound, after the user clicks or taps on the site, or (on desktop) if the user has previously shown an interest in media on the site.
							<br><br>
							Another follow-up update will arrive soon, which will provide further options to mitigate these restrictions. Since it's governed by the browser, there is no way to restore the previous behavior. However, we can supply alternate options like autoplaying muted videos where visitors can restore sound with a separate button.
						</li>

								<li>Countless other improvements like marking hidden slides, intelligently counting slides, creating duplicates next to their origin, etc.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>To take advantage of the new slide tabs and have gorgeous slide previews, a new "capture slide" option has been added.

								<li>RocketScript compatibility: CloudFlare's Rocket Loader now has a dedicated option to ignore LayerSlider's files, which helps avoiding certain issues.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Improvements</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>For easier access, you can now right click on sliders in the grid view to display slider actions, which would be available with the arrow icon otherwise.</li>

						<li>Updated developer documentation focusing on licensing terms and theme integration.</li>

						<li>Various other bug fixes and improvement under the hood.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Changes in LayerSlider 6.6.2</h3>
					<p>This release focuses on efficiency and bringing you meaningful improvements and bug fixes.</p>

					<h4>Efficiency</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>LayerSlider now uses a slightly more compact and efficient source code out of the box.</li>
						<li>Disabling the 'Use srcset attribute' option now completely removes the srcset and sizes attributes from the generated source code instead of just disregarding them in the plugin internals. This can drastically reduce the generated source code size.</li>
						<li>Dropdown select boxes under layer styles now include an 'Inherit from theme' option. This new and now default value means that you have no preference for a given option and your WP theme is free to apply its own styles (if any). This makes possible to generate a much cleaner and more efficient source code, but you can still apply any styling settings you want in order to match the appearance with the front-end.</li>
						<li>Added Enhanced lazy load option to Slider Settings -> Misc in Advanced Mode. Please read the option description on the admin interface to learn more.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Other improvements</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>The Template Store now shows a warning message in all cases when it encounters a server issue.</li>
						<li>Some minor changes that make using the Slider Builder interface more convenient.</li>
					</ul>


					<h4>Bug fixes</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Fixed all known issues with the new linking fields that was introduced in the previous update.</li>
						<li>Fixed displaying the most recent snapshot in Revisions.</li>
						<li>Fixed a PHP debug message displayed in rare cases.</li>
					</ul>


					<h3>Changes in LayerSlider 6.6.1</h3>
					<p>Among other improvements and bug fixes, this release mainly focuses on media handling and the complete overhaul of how links work in LayerSlider.</p>

					<h4>Improved linking</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li><b>Page/Post chooser:</b> Linking fields now offer an option to choose a Page, Post or Attachment on your site. With built-in search, you can easily and quickly select any content you want to link to.</li>
						<li><b>Auto-generated URLs:</b> When you use this new Page/Post chooser option, WordPress will automatically generate the appropriate URLs to make sure they follow your permalink settings and play nice with other plugins like WPML.</li>
						<li><b>Link bindings:</b> The Page, Post or Attachment you choose with this new option will be tied to the chosen item, which allows LayerSlider to track changes on your site. No more broken links due to permalink changes or anything else.</li>
						<li><b>Formatted URL fields:</b> Linking fields also received some UI changes to better reflect your settings. When you use the built-in features, they will show descriptive messages like "Linked to WP Post: Hello world!" or "LayerSlider Action: Switch to the next slide" instead of displaying arbitrary URLs, which aren't that helpful in most cases.</li>
						<li><b>Attachments:</b> When you choose an attachment, the link will directly point to the file instead of the attachment page. This is helpful when you want to use 3rd party items like a Lightbox/Fancybox plugin.</li>
						<li><b>Compatibility:</b> Your sliders will continue to work the same. The linking field is there as it was, you are free to manually enter whatever URL you would like to use. However, the above described advantages are only available if you use the newly introduced options.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Improved media handling</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li><b>Modal window:</b> Media layers now have a dedicated modal window where you can easily add video / audio. A preview feature has been added to see the results prior making the changes.</li>
						<li><b>Insert from URL:</b> Added option to insert videos from YouTube or Vimeo URL.</li>
						<li><b>Inline editing:</b> Similarly to other layer types, you can now double click on media layers in the Preview to bring up the "Insert Media" modal window.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Other improvements</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Improved Preview selection.</li>
						<li>FontAwesome is a popular icon font to display icons. Since several 3rd party items also use it, it was possible that some icons did not appear in your front-end sliders because another theme or plugin loaded an older version. LayerSlider now makes sure to always load its own built-in version that is up-to-date.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Bug fixes</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Links now correctly follow hover transitions.</li>
						<li>The WP Media Library now properly displays uploaded video and audio files.</li>
						<li>Fixed a PHP notice, which occurred in case of embedding an empty slider without layers on your front-end pages with WP Debug Mode enabled.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Changes in LayerSlider 6.6.0</h3>
					<p>This release focuses on improving the Slider Builder. It brings long awaited and highly requested editing capabilities as well as new new features that will enhance your content in many ways.</p>

					<h4>New editor features</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li><b>Import slides:</b> With just a couple of clicks, you can import any slide from any slider you have on your site. You don't even have to navigate away, it will be added right into the editor where you want it.</li>
						<li><b>Import layers:</b> Similarly to slides, a nice UI will help you to import any layer from any slider quickly and super easily.</li>
						<li><b>New Context Menu:</b> Right clicking in the Preview area will open the new context menu. It allows you to select common tasks like adding/removing/duplicating layers as well as to perform copy/paste operations, aligning layers and many more. The old behavior to list and select overlapping layers is also integrated into this new solution.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>New layer & content types</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li><b>Button layer:</b> Buttons now have a dedicated layer type. They also received some presets you can easily apply to have different types of buttons with different styles.</li>
						<li><b>Icon layer:</b> There's also a new Icon layer type. You can choose from 675 pictographs to easily include them in your sliders.</li>
						<li><b>Icon support:</b> Icons can also be used in combination with other layer types like Buttons, Text or HTML layers.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Editor changes</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li><b>Choose before adding:</b> The Add New button now acts as a drop down to choose the type of layer you want to use. Certain layer types (Image & Icon) now immediately prompts you to select the content you want to add. For example, in case of an Image layer, this would be the WordPress Media Library where you can immediately select or upload an image.</li>
						<li><b>Layer placeholders:</b> No more invisible "contentless" layers. Now every layer type has a placeholder that visually represents it within the editor.</li>
						<li><b>Inline editing:</b> Double clicking on layers to edit them right in the Preview area now works with non-textual contents as well like Icon or Image layers. In those cases the modal window to add/replace an icon or image will open.</li>
						<li><b>Align layer options</b>: besides the grid view, now you can also align layers along the horizontal or vertical axis separately.</li>
						<li><b>Layer-less slides</b>: Slides no longer have an included empty layer by default.</li>
					</ul>


					<h4>Other new features</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Added "Skip Slide Breaks" option for Play By Scroll sliders to eliminate the stop between slide changes.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Improvements</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Improved compatibility with image preloaders.</li>
						<li>Special effects like the Origami transition can now be mixed with regular slide transitions.</li>
						<li>Prevent re-initializing sliders on the same element multiple times.</li>
						<li>Improved compatibility with GSAP sandboxing enabled.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Bug fixes</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Fixed rewinding video / audio layers after changing slides.</li>
						<li>Fixed Play By Scroll starting position detection.</li>
						<li>Fixed global background size option not always working as expected.</li>
						<li>Fixed an issue that could break layer styles in rare cases.</li>
						<li>Many more under the hood fixes and improvements.</li>
						<li>
							Fixes for developers:
							<ul class="nomargin">
								<li>Fixed an issue with the destroy API method.</li>
								<li>Fixes for overriding default settings like skins that not always worked as expected.</li>
								<li>Fixes in the LS_Sources class that affected externally loaded skins and other materials.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

						<li>Fixed rare issues with layer selection, layer locking and undoing changes, which affected the Slider Builder in very specific cases.</li>
						<li>Fixed previewing Play By Scroll sliders, which previously left the Slider Builder in a non-scrollable state.</li>
					</ul>


					<h3>Changes in LayerSlider 6.5.7</h3>
					<p>This update fixes a PHP debug message displayed when your site has the WP debug mode enabled.</p>

					<h3>Changes in LayerSlider 6.5.6</h3>
					<p></p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>
							Changes of media layers:
							<ul class="nomargin">
								<li>Autoplaying videos will no longer display the play icon for that brief moment, making background videos and in other cases a perfectly smooth video surface.</li>
								<li>You now have the option to set the volume of background videos. They are muted by default and there was no way to change that previously.</li>
								<li>The 'Controls' and 'Show Info' media layer settings now include an 'Auto' option. It is based on the most common use cases and respects settings set by the embed code or HTML attributes.</li>
								<li>The 'Controls' option for media layers was not working as expected in some cases. For example, you can now enable controls for audio layers as well.</li>
								<li>Media layers are now properly pause and resume playback (based on your settings) when closing/re-opening a Popup slider.</li>

						<li>

							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>Fixed an issue that caused Google to index the 'static' plugin folder causing unwanted search results.</li>
						<li>Fixed the OS native fullscreen mode in Firefox.</li>
						<li>Fixed previewing the Origami transition in the Slider Builder.</li>

					<h3>Changes in LayerSlider 6.4.0</h3>
					<p></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Bonjour! Thanks to <a href="https://codecanyon.net/user/conseillerphytoaroma" target="_blank">conseillerphytoaroma</a>, LayerSlider is now fully translated into French.</li>
						<li>Sziasztok! We've also added an experimental Hungarian localization in this release.</li>
						<li>Psst! More languages are on their way! Internationalization in LayerSlider underwent a major overhaul to provide high quality localizations and make translators' life much easier.</li>
						<li>The English locale has also been updated. Instead of using typewriter characters, we now have nicely formatted punctuation with curly quotes and apostrophes.</li>
						<li>Added new Google Fonts script subsets: Arabic, Bengali, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Hebrew, Kannada, Malayalam, Myanmar, Oriya, Sinhala, Tamil, Telugu and Thai. Welcome, newcomers! :)</li>
						<li>In cooperation with WPBakery, this update introduce changes to improve compatibility & integration with future versions of Visual Composer. Developers should check our updated <a href="developers.html#filter-hooks">Filters reference</a> in the Developer documentation.</li>
						<li>Added "Important Notice" feature. In cases of important and urgent matters, we can now display a small banner on the admin dashboard to notify everyone. These might be security issues or other justifiable cases. Hopefully, you will never see any of them. :)</li>
						<li>Entirely new WordPress text editor plugin to insert sliders into your posts and pages. Besides its drastically improved user interface, it also supports keyboard shortcuts, multiple selections and embed options.</li>
						<li>Added a new premium feature: Global Hover. Create spectacular effects by triggering the Hover Transitions of all layers at once when you hover over the slider with your mouse cursor. A simple example demonstrating this <a href="https://layerslider.kreaturamedia.com/sliders/global-hover-example/" target="_blank">can be found here</a>.</li>
						<li>Added "Start immediately" option to the Play by Scroll feature. Now it's possible to automatically start playback and only pause sliders at the first keyframe instead of waiting users to scroll down.</li>
						<li>Added option to override the starting slide of sliders in the shortcode and widget settings.</li>
						<li>Added letter spacing option to layer styles so you can change the character density in a line or block of text.</li>
					</ul>


					<h5>Improvements</h5>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Enabled word wrapping in CodeMirror code editors.</li>
						<li>The System Status now has better recommendations with providing the ideal values of each setting.</li>
						<li>While LayerSlider continues to require PHP 5.3.0 or newer, on the global scope it no longer uses language features that is not available in PHP 5.2.4. This ensures better overall compatibility with WordPress on pages where LayerSlider is not being actively used.</li>
						<li>Updated documentation to fix page jumping issues when deeplinking.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>What's new in LayerSlider 6?</h2>
					<h3>Faster, Better, Prettier</h3>
					<p>Both the admin interface and front-end sliders load faster and perform better. This release has numerous bug fixes and improvements. So much actually, that we can't even write a complete list. The admin interface has also been redesigned a bit to provide familiar but much cleaner and easier controls.</p>

					<h3>Reworked Responsive Mode, New Slider Layouts, Device Dependent Layouts</h3>
					<p>The new responsive mode performs significantly better and in most cases it does not require any special configuration. LayerSlider now also have multiple new layout modes like full size, hero screne and full screen sliders. These will allow new use cases such as running slideshows on billboards. It's also possible to make different layouts for different devices (phones, tables, desktop).</p>

					<h3>New Transitions, Text Animations, Loop, Hover, Filters and a lot more</h3>
					<p>We've added lots of new transition options, which greatly extends the capabilities of your slideshows. You can now create chainable multi-step animations enhanced with stylish text transitions and interactive hover animations. There's also hidden surprises like the much requested Ken Burns effect, 3D parallax effect, and our new "play by scroll" feature. Oh, and don't forget to try out filters, which can be used to apply blur, sepia, grayscale etc. effects to your layers among many other.</p>

					<h3>Static Layers</h3>
					<p>Layers can now enter and leave on any slide. You can easily build more complex animations where layers persist across multiple slides. Or just use it as an "always on top" feature.</p>

					<h3>Undo and Redo</h3>
					<p>Web apps usually don't have controls to undo unwanted/accidental changes. LayerSlider now has. And it's even preserved for later use, whenever you need it.</p>

					<h3>Multi-selection, Resize, Rulers + Guides</h3>
					<p>Do you ever wanted to move around multiple layers and once? LayerSlider 6 now supports multiple selection, which allows you altering groups of layers seamlessly. With rulers and keyboard shortcuts, you can now move/resize/etc your layers with precision. There's also Guides and a snap to feature built in.</p>

					<h3>Keyboard shortcuts &amp; Popout Editor</h3>
					<p>The slider builder interface can now be controlled by keyboard shortcuts. These shortcuts also introduces a lot of new features, like editing layers content right in the preview area or copying and pasting layers across slides and sliders. We've also introduced the Popout Editor, which transforms the layer options area into a floating window that can be resized and placed wherever you want. This makes it extremely easy to edit everything in one place, without the need to scroll up and down constantly.</p>

					<h3>Image Editor</h3>
					<p>With the help of Adobe's Creative SDK, LayerSlider 6 now has a built-in image editor. You can perform common tasks like resizing, cropping, rotating images, as well as photo retouching, adding frames, text, effects, stickers and a lot more. It's like a mini-Photoshop.</p>

					<h3>And a lot more ...</h3>
					<p>There's way more new features and improvement that we can list here: scheduled sliders, retina-ready, serving dynamically scaled images to reduce data usage and speed up page loads on mobile devices, redesigned transition builder with import feature, continuous live previews, new interactive timeline, reworked multimedia layer support with custom video poster and controls, custom HTML attributes, drag 'n' drop image upload, smart links, copy &amp; paste layer styles and transition settings, named slides, new slider/slide background settings, auto-fit zoom, align layers feature. </p>
					<p>The number of new features almost never end, but this list must. :)</p>

					<h3>The future of LayerSlider</h3>
					<p>LayerSlider 6 is just the beginning of our awesome new ideas. One of the main goals was to completely rebuild the plugin architecture and modernize its core. This allows us to implement new features way more faster and improve upon existing functionality with an easily maintainable code base. Beyond the predictable feature updates like the complete overhaul of skins, dynamic contents, etc (which will arrive very soon); we already have an experimental offline slider editor and preliminary support for LayerSlider extensions. This later one will soon be available for anyone to extend the plugins capabilities.</p>

					<h3>Changes in version 5.6.0</h3>
					<ul>
						 <li>
							<strong>Huge performance boost:</strong>
							<p>Our Slider Builder interface loads and works drastically faster, while it uses considerably less resources on both the server and client-side. The amount of content you add to sliders no longer has an impact on performance, the editor should always be fast and responsive. This also fixes the memory limit and execution time issues on servers with limited resources.</p>
						 </li>
						 <li>
							<strong> Caching slider markup:</strong>
							<p>LayerSlider now uses its own caching mechanism to spare your server from unnecessary load. Most installations support memory caching, which provides instant access to your sliders based on visiting frequency. This means that a slider on your front-page could stay in memory for improved speed, but another one in a sub-page might fall back to regular disk cache to free up resources for the content matters the most.</p>
						 </li>
						 <li>
							<strong>Minor interface changes:</strong>
							<p>We made a minor interface change in the list of layers, which you hopefully find familiar. Hiding/locking layers now has a permanent effect. The layer settings section has been placed closer to the preview, so you need to scroll less.</p>

				<h1>Support</h1>

				<h2 data-target="support-reporting">Before reporting an issue</h2>
				<p>There are some common practices you should try before reporting an issue:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Check System Status</strong><br>
						Select <code>LayerSlider -> Options</code> from your WordPress admin sidebar, then click on the <code>System Status</code> button. The page displayed there is intended to help you identifying common issues and to display relevant debug information about your site. Always try the recommendations provided by this menu (if any) before reporting an issue.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Always use the latest software versions!</strong><br> This includes your WordPress installation, LayerSlider, the WP theme you're using and any other plugin installed on your site. Third party plugins and themes (not hosted on wordpress.org) may not update automatically. Taking care to keep everything up-to-date can spare you from a lot of problems and frustration.</li>
					<li><strong>Try to find the source of the problem!</strong><br> Issues could be related to other plugins/themes and their settings. We often ask our customers to temporarily disable other plugins and switch to one of the default WP themes. This way we can verify that the issue is related to LayerSlider, and is not an incompatibility with another item. If it solves the problem, you can find which item caused the trouble by re-enabling them one-by-one and watching when the issue comes back.</li>
					<li><strong>Try to find a solution!</strong><br> A lot of times issues occur due to incorrect settings or other environmental factors. It's always a good idea to quickly review your settings and try to find a solution in the documentation or online by searching through our <a href="https://support.kreaturamedia.com/faq/4/layerslider-for-wordpress/" target="_blank">FAQs</a> and the <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/layerslider-responsive-wordpress-slider-plugin-/1362246/comments" target="_blank">comments section</a>.</li>
				</ul>
